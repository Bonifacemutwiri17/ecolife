# EcoLife – Responsive Design Implementation

## 🎯 Project Goal
Recreate the provided LG breakpoint mockup while showcasing a unique brand and responsive design for SM and MD breakpoints.

## 🎨 Color System
| Role      | Color (Hex) | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Primary   | #14532d     | Dark green represents eco‑consciousness and trust |
| Secondary | #fef9c3     | Light beige background keeps the design clean and natural |
| Accent    | #f97316     | Coral orange provides energetic emphasis for calls‑to‑action |

All color pairings were tested with the WebAIM Contrast Checker and pass WCAG AA standards.

## 🧱 Breakpoints
- **LG (≥ 1024 px)** – 3‑column card grid, matches mockup card sizes, orientation, and spacing.
- **MD (768–1023 px)** – 2‑column grid, compact navigation.
- **SM (< 768 px)** – 1‑column layout, collapsible hamburger navigation.

## 💡 Creative Divergences
- Custom “EcoLife” branding, logo, and nature‑inspired color palette.
- Eco‑wellness content replaces all placeholder text and imagery.
- Mobile‑first, accessible navigation and interactive FAQ/components.
